## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mern_practical
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
```

### Run the server

```
node server.js
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Auth Routes

**Register**

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

**Login**

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

---

### 🛍 Product Routes

**Add Product (Protected)**

```
POST /api/products
```

**Get Products**

```
GET /api/products
```

---

### 💳 Payment API

```
POST /api/payment
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Flow

1. Register
2. Login → copy token
3. Add product (with token)
4. Get products
5. Test payment

# 📘 Development Progress (Learning Log)

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Project Setup

### Completed:

* Initialized Node.js project
* Installed dependencies
* Configured `.gitignore`

### Learned:

* Role of `package.json`
* Dependency management
* Importance of ignoring sensitive/large files

---

## 🚀 Phase 2.1: Basic Server

### Completed:

* Created Express server
* Added middleware
* Implemented root route

### Learned:

* Server lifecycle
* Routing basics
* Middleware concept

---

## 🗄 Phase 2.2: Database Connection

### Completed:

* Installed MongoDB
* Configured service
* Connected using Mongoose

### Learned:

* Client–database connection flow
* Connection string structure
* Async operations in backend

---

## 👤 Phase 2.3: User Model

### Completed:
- Created User schema
- Defined email and password fields

### Learned:
- Schema defines structure of data
- Model is used to interact with database
- MongoDB stores data as documents

---

## 🔐 Phase 2.4: Register API

### Completed:
- Implemented user registration route
- Added password hashing using bcrypt
- Stored user data in MongoDB

### Learned:
- How POST requests send data to server
- Passwords must be hashed before storing
- Data flows from client → server → database

---

## 🔑 Phase 2.5: Login API (JWT)

### Completed:
- Implemented login route
- Verified user credentials
- Generated JWT token

### Learned:
- Authentication verifies user identity
- JWT is used as a secure identity token
- Password comparison uses bcrypt

---

## 🛡 Phase 2.6: Middleware (Auth)

### Completed:
- Created JWT authentication middleware
- Verified token from request headers

### Learned:
- Middleware controls request flow
- Token verification protects routes

---

## 🛍 Phase 2.7-2.8: Product API & Image Upload

### Completed:
- Created Product model
- Implemented add and get product APIs
- Protected product creation using JWT middleware
- Integrated Multer for image upload
- Stored uploaded image paths in database

### Learned:
- How middleware protects routes using tokens
- How file uploads are handled in backend
- Difference between JSON and form-data requests
- How backend stores file references

---

## 💳 Phase 2.9: Payment API (Mock)

### Completed:
- Implemented mock payment endpoint
- Handled success and failure cases based on amount

### Learned:
- How APIs simulate real-world services
- Request validation basics
- Response status handling

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

A complete backend system was developed with:

- User authentication using JWT
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Protected routes using middleware
- Product management APIs
- Image upload functionality using Multer
- Mock payment integration
- API testing using Postman

This project demonstrates core backend development concepts in a structured and practical manner.
